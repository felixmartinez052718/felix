        <h5>EFFECT OF THE DATASSELING OF CORN YIELD PRODUCTION</h5>
 
        <h4>CHAPTER 1</h4>
 
        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
 
        <h4>Nature and Important OF the study</h4>
        <pr>Corn (Zea maize L) rank next to rice as the stable food crop in the philippines.The aboout 85% of our total corn production is consumed as human
        food. The rest is use for livestock, poultry in the manufacture of corn by products (book of knowledge,1996)
        Corn in the philippines can be planted depending upon the season; from October to December (dry season); april to june (rainy season); or from
        December to February (third crop). However, corn groth is the kaingin system (Jack Kramer 2005).
        Corn plant has a perfect flower. However, the male (tassel) and female (silk) flowers were found separately in one plant. This study will venture on the
        removal of the male flower (tassel) of corn plant at the tasseling stage and determined if tassel removal had a direct effect on the yield performance of
        corn at harvest time. Under calbayog condition no study has been conducted in this aspect thus, this study is strongly proposed.</pr>
        
        <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
        <pr>This study was conducted specifically to:
        1. Determine the yield performace of corn as affected by detasseling;
        2. Evaluate the effects of the frequency of detasseling on the yield performace of corn plant; and
        3. Compare the economic returns of growing corn as affected by detasseling.
        
        <h4>SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS</h4>
        
        <pr>This study was limited only on the effects of detasseling on yhe yeild of corn. The corn variety used in this study was white corn.This was conducted
        at Brgy.Dagum, Calbayog City.</pr>
        
        <h4>TIME AND PLACE OF THE STUDY</h4>
        <pr>>This study was conducted at Brgy.Dagum, purok 3, Calbayog City starting from April 14 2007 up to july 6, 2007</pr
